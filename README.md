# ML_UnityVR_Task
 Task directory for MonkeyLogic (Mar 23, 2019 build 182) to interface with Unity via LSL

Simply copy the repo in the task folder of monkeylogic. Keep in mind that the LSL library for Matlab was compiled for a 64bit windows 10 machine. You might need to recompile for your specific system. 

I'm using MonkeyLogic version Mar 23 2019 build 182. But I didn't change the source so it should work on anything after that. 

The installer I used should be in the gdrive link of the Temp repo.
